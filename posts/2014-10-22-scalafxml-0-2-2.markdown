I've released a new version of [ScalaFXML](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml), which now supports _both_ [ScalaFX 8](https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx) with _JavaFX 8_ on Java 8, and [ScalaFX 2.2](https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx) with _JavaFX 2.x_ on Java 7.

The two branches are separated by the `sfx2` and `sfx8` postfixes, and both are available for _Scala_ `2.10.x` and `2.11.x`.

To use it with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) on Java 7:

```scala
addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.0.1" cross CrossVersion.full)

libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx" % "2.2.67-R10"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafxml-core-sfx2" % "0.2.2"
```

And on Java 8:

```scala
addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.0.1" cross CrossVersion.full)

libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafx" % "8.0.20-R6"

libraryDependencies += "org.scalafx" %% "scalafxml-core-sfx8" % "0.2.2"
```
