## Intro
The [first post](2019-02-10-prox-1-types.html) introduced the _prox library_ and demonstrated the advanced type level programming techniques it uses. Then in the [second part](2019-03-07-prox-2-io-akkastreams.html) of this series we experimented with replacing the _streaming library_ from [fs2](https://fs2.io/) to [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/stream/). 

In both cases the library used [cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) for describing side effects. But it did not really take advantage of _cats-effect_'s effect abstraction: it explicitly defined everything to be a computation in [`IO`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/datatypes/io.html), cats-effect's implementation of describing effectful computations.

But we can do better! By not relying on `IO` but the various type classes the _cats-effect_ library provides we can make _prox_ work with any kind of effect library out of the box. One such example is [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio).

## Effect abstraction

Let's see an example of how `IO` used to be used in the library! The following function is in the `Start` type class, and it starts a process or piped process group:

```scala
def apply(process: PN, dontStartOutput: Boolean = false, blocker: Blocker)
         (implicit contextShift: ContextShift[IO]): IO[RunningProcesses]
```

We can observe two things here:
- The function returns an effectful computation in `IO`
- An implicit _context shifter_ is needed by the implementations which are calling some streaming functions needing it.

To make it independent of the effect library implementation we have to get rid of `IO` and use a generic type instead, let's call it `F`:

```scala
def apply(process: PN, 
          dontStartOutput: Boolean = false, 
          blocker: Blocker)
         (implicit
          concurrent: Concurrent[F],
          contextShift: ContextShift[F]): F[RunningProcesses]
```

Beside using `F` instead of `IO` everywhere we also have a new requirement, our context type (`F`) have to have an implementation of the [`Concurrent`](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/typeclasses/concurrent.html) type class.

_Cats-effect_ defines a hierarchy of type classes to deal with effectful computations. At the time of writing it looks like this:
<img src="https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/img/cats-effect-typeclasses.svg"/>

Read the [official documentation](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/typeclasses/) for more information.

Prox is based on the `ProcessNode` type which has two implementations, a single `Process` or a set of processes piped together to a `PipedProcess`. Because these types store their I/O redirection within themselves, they also have to be enriched with a context type parameter.

For example `Process` will look like this:

```scala
class Process[F[_], Out, Err, OutResult, ErrResult, IRS <: RedirectionState, ORS <: RedirectionState, ERS <: RedirectionState]
(val command: String,
 val arguments: List[String],
 val workingDirectory: Option[Path],
 val inputSource: ProcessInputSource[F],
 val outputTarget: ProcessOutputTarget[F, Out, OutResult],
 val errorTarget: ProcessErrorTarget[F, Err, ErrResult],
 val environmentVariables: Map[String, String],
 val removedEnvironmentVariables: Set[String])
  extends ProcessNode[Out, Err, IRS, ORS, ERS] {
    // ...
}
```

The context parameter (`F`) is needed because the _input source_ and _output target_ are all representing effectful code such as writing to the standard output, reading from a file, or passing data through concurrent streams.

Let's see some examples of how the abstract types of _cats-effect_ can be used to describe the computation, when we cannot rely on `IO` itself!

The most basic operation is to _delay the execution_ of some code that does not use the effect abstractions. This is how we wrap the Java process API, for example.

While with the original implementation of _prox_ it was done by using the `IO` constructor:

```scala
IO {
    systemProcess.isAlive
}
```

with an arbitrary `F` we only need to require that it has an implementation of the `Sync` type class:

```scala
private class WrappedProcess[F[_] : Sync,  // ...
```

and then use the `delay` function:

```scala
Sync[F].delay {
    systemProcess.isAlive
}
```

Similarily the `Concurrent` type class can be used to start a concurrent computation on a _fiber_:

```scala
Concurrent[F].start(stream.compile.toVector)
```

## Type level

This would be it - except that we need one more thing because of the type level techniques described in the [first post](2019-02-10-prox-1-types.html).

To understand the problem, let's see how the _output redirection_ operator works. It is implemented as an _extension method_ on the `ProcessNode` type:

```scala
implicit class ProcessNodeOutputRedirect[PN <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, NotRedirected, _]](processNode: PN) {
    def >[F[_], To, NewOut, NewOutResult, Result <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, Redirected, _]]
    (to: To)
    (implicit
     target: CanBeProcessOutputTarget.Aux[F, To, NewOut, NewOutResult],
     redirectOutput: RedirectOutput.Aux[F, PN, To, NewOut, NewOutResult, Result]): Result = {
      redirectOutput(processNode, to)
    }
}
```

This extension method basically just finds the appropriate type class implementations and then call it to alter the process node to register the output redirection:
- we are redirecting the output of `processNode` (of type `PN`) to `to` (of type `To`)
- `target` is the `CanBeProcessOutputTarget` implementation, containing the actual code to set up the redirection
- `redirectOutput` is the process node type specific implementation of the `RedirectOutput` interface, knowing how to set up the redirection of a `Process` or a `PipedProcess`

This code would compile, but we won't be able to use it. For example for the following code:

```scala
running <- (Process[IO]("echo", List("Hello world!")) > tempFile.toPath).start(blocker)
```

It fails with not being able to resolve the implicits correctly. The exact error of course depends much on the context but one example for the above line could be:

```
[error] prox/src/test/scala/io/github/vigoo/prox/ProcessSpecs.scala:95:63: diverging implicit expansion for type cats.effect.Concurrent[F]
[error] starting with method catsIorTConcurrent in object Concurrent
[error]         running <- (Process[IO]("echo", List("Hello world!")) > tempFile.toPath).start(blocker)
```

This does not really help understanding the real problem though. As we have seen earlier, in this library the `Process` types have to be parameterized with the context as well, because they store their redirection logic within themselves. That's why we specify it explicitly in the example to be `IO`: `Process[IO](...)`. What we would expect is that by tying `F[_]` to `IO` at the beginning, all the subsequent operations such as the `>` redirection would respect this and the context gets inferred to be `IO` everywhere in the expression.

The compiler cannot do this. If we check the definition of `>` again, you can see that there is no connection expressed between the type `PN` (the actual process node type) and `F` which is used as a type parameter for the implicit parameters.

The fix is to link the two, and we have a technique exactly for this that I described earlier: the _aux pattern_.

First let's write some code that, in compile time, can "extract" the context type from a process node type:

```scala
trait ContextOf[PN] {
  type Context[_]
}

object ContextOf {
  type Aux[PN, F[_]] = ContextOf[PN] {
    type Context[_] = F[_]
  }

  def apply[PN <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, _, _], F[_]](implicit contextOf: ContextOf.Aux[PN, F]): Aux[PN, F] = contextOf

  implicit def contextOfProcess[F[_], Out, Err, OutResult, ErrResult, IRS <: RedirectionState, ORS <: RedirectionState, ERS <: RedirectionState]:
  Aux[Process[F, Out, Err, OutResult, ErrResult, IRS, ORS, ERS], F] =
    new ContextOf[Process[F, Out, Err, OutResult, ErrResult, IRS, ORS, ERS]] {
      override type Context[_] = F[_]
    }

  implicit def contextOfPipedProcess[
  F[_],
  Out, Err,
  PN1 <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, _, _],
  PN2 <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, _, _],
  IRS <: RedirectionState, ORS <: RedirectionState, ERS <: RedirectionState]:
  Aux[PipedProcess[F, Out, Err, Byte, PN1, PN2, IRS, ORS, ERS], F] =
    new ContextOf[PipedProcess[F, Out, Err, Byte, PN1, PN2, IRS, ORS, ERS]] {
      override type Context[_] = F[_]
    }
}
```

Both `Process` and `PipedProcess` have the context as their first type parameter. By creating the `ContextOf` type class and the corresponding `Aux` type we can extend the `>` operator to _require_ such a connection (a way to get a `F[_]` context out of a type `PN`) in compile time, and with the aux pattern it unifies the type parameters and the context type gets _chained_ through all the subsequent calls as we desired:

```scala
def >[F[_], To, NewOut, NewOutResult, Result <: ProcessNode[_, _, _, Redirected, _]]
    (to: To)
    (implicit
     contextOf: ContextOf.Aux[PN, F],
     target: CanBeProcessOutputTarget.Aux[F, To, NewOut, NewOutResult],
     redirectOutput: RedirectOutput.Aux[F, PN, To, NewOut, NewOutResult, Result]): Result = {
      redirectOutput(processNode, to)
    }
```

## ZIO

Now that everything is in place, we can try out whether _prox_ is really working with other effect libraries such as [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio).

_ZIO_ has a compatibility layer for _cats-effect_. It's the implementation of the type classes cats-effect provides. It is in an extra library called [zio-interop-cats](https://github.com/zio/interop-cats). 

For running processes with _prox_ we can use the following variants of the `ZIO` type:

- `RIO[-R, +A]` which is an alias for `ZIO[R, scala.Throwable, A]`
- or `Task[A]` which is an alias for `ZIO[scala.Any, scala.Throwable, A]` if we don't take advantage of the environment parameter `R`.

This in fact assuming the correct context only means switching `IO` to `RIO` or `Task` in the type parameter for `Process`:

```scala
import zio.interop.catz._

Blocker[RIO[Console, ?]].use { blocker =>
  for {
      // ...
      _ <- console.putStrLn("Starting external process...")
      _ <- (Process[Task]("echo", List("Hello world!")) > tempFile.toPath).start(blocker)
      // ...
  } yield ()
}
```

A nice way to have everything set up for this is to use the interop library's [`CatsApp`](https://zio.dev/docs/interop/interop_catseffect#cats-app) trait as an entrypoint for the application.

This brings all the necessary implicits in scope and requires you to implement the following function as the entry point of the application:

```scala
def run(args: List[String]): ZIO[Environment, Nothing, Int]
```
