I already wrote about [bari](http://vigoo.github.io/bari) in [May](@/posts/2014-05-16-introducing-bari.md).

As a reminder, [bari](http://vigoo.github.io/bari) is a *build management system* primarily for .NET, trying to fix Visual Studio's bad parts while keeping the good ones.

After more than two years of development, and being in production at [KOTEM](http://www.kotem.com/) for almost half a year, bari reached a state when it can be considered as a *stable* and *usable* first version.

To indicate this today I released **bari 1.0**.

Try it out and feel free to give any kind of feedback or ask any questions!
